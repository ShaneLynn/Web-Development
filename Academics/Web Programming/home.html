            <p>
                Welcome to my page!  I am currently in college seeking my degree, and I have three classes left!  I went back to school to get this degree because
                I realized my love of technology and programming, and I am excited for the career prospects that this field can provide.  I have learned much over
                my degree, and I have decided that I enjoy C# and Web programming the most!  As mid-life career changer, this academic learning pace can be a challenge
                since the time demands increase as you get older.  Most is due to responsibilities, but we have so much that asks for our time these days!
            </p>
            <p>Job search wise, the world is vastly different than when I got my previous job about sixteen years ago.  Back then, it was craft a nice resume on paper 
                and deliver it to the office you want to work at.  Today, not only do you have to craft a short and sweet resume that can be read by an automated system.
                But, you also need to update social media platforms, and create an account with every company you want to apply for.  Plus those resumes better be custom
                designed to fit where you want to go!
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for reading this far, as this is my first web page in awhile!  When I am not in school, I enjoy the finer things in life that allow you to detach
                and get away from the world.  I enjoy reading and watching movies/tv shows and the occasional video game when the mood hits.  I like being outdoors, and
                when the pandemic is finally over, I will get back into my previous martial arts training pattern to get out in nature and maybe lose a little weight in
                the process!
