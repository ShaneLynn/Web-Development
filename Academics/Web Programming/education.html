                        <h3>My Education</h3>
                        <p>I have spent quite a bit of time pursuing education. I love to learn, but I finished my Bachelor's degree
                            in Psychology in 2012 and thought I was done. Well, almost 10 years later, I went back to school for
                            more
                            fun and started in my current degree in Computer Info Systems. Psychology was fun, but I was not landing
                            the
                            work that interested me and it was a toss-up between computers and psychology the first time. I want to
                            share
                            three awesome schools I have attended over the years.

                        <p>My current home away from home. Columbia College gave me the start I needed when I first went back to
                            college
                            many years after I graduated from high school. I am only listing this school once even though I am
                            getting two
                            degrees here to save space and to be able to showcase the others. The main campus is located in
                            Columbia, MO and they offer small
                            class sizes of around 20 students. This was a large deciding factor to go here for the extra support the
                            instructors
                            can provide to the students. They offer financing, many degrees, and online options.

                        <p>My high school of choice for the Columbia area, I have many great memories from this school. I went here
                            in the late
                            1990's, and so much has changed since then. But, this public high school offers a great education with
                            the core philosophy
                            of freedom with responsiblity. The course structure here is flexibile and sets up students for a college
                            feel in determining
                            your classes of interest while meeting the credits needed to graduate. One of its most defining features
                            is the inclusion of
                            a planetarium on the grounds that is open to school trips but also to the public once or twice a month.

                        <p>My elementary school has changed much over the years, but not enough to not be unfamiliar. This school
                            prides itself in its
                            support and development of the students. And it has a guided philosophy similar to RBHS, but structured
                            enough to keep
                            the children on task. This public school provides a good education, and it is tucked away at the edge of
                            Rock Bridge State Park
                            so it provides a focused environment for kids with no distractions around them. One neat feature of this
                            school is the photographs
                            they take of all graduating classes that they display all around the school. When I went back there to
                            visit while my son attended,
                            I was able to see myself and my graduating class over 15 years ago at the time.
