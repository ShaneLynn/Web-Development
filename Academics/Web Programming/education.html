            <h3>My Education</h3>
            <p>I have spent quite a bit of time pursuing education.  I love to learn, but I finished my Bachelor's degree
                in Psychology in 2012 and thought I was done.  Well, almost 10 years later, I went back to school for more
                fun and started in my current degree in Computer Info Systems.  Psychology was fun, but I was not landing the
                work that interested me and it was a toss-up between computers and psychology the first time.  I want to share
                three awesome schools I have attended over the years.

            <p>My current home away from home.  Columbia College gave me the start I needed when I first went back to college
                many years after I graduated from high school.  I am only listing this school once even though I am getting two
                degrees here to save space and to be able to showcase the others.  The main campus is located in Columbia, MO and they offer small
                class sizes of around 20 students.  This was a large deciding factor to go here for the extra support the instructors
                can provide to the students.  They offer financing, many degrees, and online options.

        <section id="school2">
            <img alt="Rock Bridge High School Photo" src="RBHS.jpg">
            <p>My high school of choice for the Columbia area, I have many great memories from this school.  I went here in the late
                1990's, and so much has changed since then.  But, this public high school offers a great education with the core philosophy
                of freedom with responsiblity.  The course structure here is flexibile and sets up students for a college feel in determining
                your classes of interest while meeting the credits needed to graduate.  One of its most defining features is the inclusion of
                a planetarium on the grounds that is open to school trips but also to the public once or twice a month.

        <section id="school3">
            <img alt="Rock Bridge Elementary Photo" src="RBES.gif">
            <p>My elementary school has changed much over the years, but not enough to not be unfamiliar.  This school prides itself in its
                support and development of the students.  And it has a guided philosophy similar to RBHS, but structured enough to keep
                the children on task.  This public school provides a good education, and it is tucked away at the edge of Rock Bridge State Park
                so it provides a focused environment for kids with no distractions around them.  One neat feature of this school is the photographs
                they take of all graduating classes that they display all around the school.  When I went back there to visit while my son attended,
                I was able to see myself and my graduating class over 15 years ago at the time.
